**URGENT NOTE -- The addStudent() function takes an SQL.Date type, so if you are testing and want to enter a new student, make sure to use Date.valueOf("YYYY-MM-DD") for the date parameter.

Steps to run after installing everything
-Open A3Q1-RayhanMoraldo/sql in pg admin and run the query
-By this point, the database should already be running so open the A3Q1-RayhanMoraldo folder in intelliJ and go to main
-In the main function you can test all the functions. 
-By default it adds me to it, changes my email, and deletes me from the database

Note*** intelliJ and pg admin were both set up following the course guidelines (i.e using Maven)
